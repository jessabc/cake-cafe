# Cake Cafe

This frontend website is for a fictious cake cafe called CAKE&CO.

This restaurant website was used as loose inspiration - [El Catrin](https://www.elcatrin.ca/) 

This is a work in progress. I would like to add a takeout feature (similiar to an ecommerce website ie with add to basket feature), reservation feature (e.g. datepicker).
